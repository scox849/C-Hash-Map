# C-Hash-Map

Simple implementation of a hashmap.    
Not all types have been tested to work.  
Strings, chars, ints have been testted and seem to work correctly.

## Usage    

### put(K key, V value)  
Inserts a key of type K and a value of type V into the hashmap.

### get(K key)  
Finds and returns the value of type V associated with the key of type K.  
Or if there is no value for the key returns empty of type V.

### clear()  
Clears all values from the hashmap.
